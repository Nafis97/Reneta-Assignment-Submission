- pickle   
## How to Run this Code
- Install all the necessary libraries and dependecies.
- Upload the Assignment for Datascience file to MyDrive and set the location of the file accordingly to read the file, in order to run this code in the colab environment.
- In order to run it on Jupyter Notebook, the excel file and Notebook should be in the same folder. If they are located in a different folder, the location needs to be specified in order to read the excel file.
## Additional Features
- I have utilized Features such as Income, Division and Gender to form different clusters to make comparisions.
- I have utilized the Elbow Method to visualize the inertia for different values of K.
- I have used the PCA clustering Algorithm to visualize the Clustering Data.
- I have used GridSearchCV for finding the optimal parameter values from a given set of parameters
- I have used pickle to save and load the models
